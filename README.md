# Wrangle and Analyze Data
This was the fourth project in Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity. In this project, I will be wrangling and analyzing the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. In addition to the Twitter archive file, two pieces of data needs to be gathered:
- The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (image_predictions.tsv) is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically.
- Each tweet's retweet count and favorite ("like") count at minimum, and any additional interesting data via Twitter's API.

## Technologies Used
Python 3.7.7 -  *Libraries: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, requests, json, random, and tweepy*.
